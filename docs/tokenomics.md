**No team allocation. No VC allocation. No airdrop.**

All tokens except the LP premine are earned through gameplay.

## Emission Schedule

- **Rate:** 1 token/second
- **Per King cap:** 7 days (604,800 tokens max per reign)
- **Total time to emit 95M:** ~3 years at continuous max rate

In practice, emissions slow as:
- Kings get dethroned before 7 days
- Time between Kings when no one is playing

## Liquidity

Initial liquidity on Uniswap V2:
- **5,000,000 LOTTERY** (5% premine)
- **1,000 USDC**
- **Initial price:** $0.0002 per LOTTERY

LP tokens are held by the deployer initially. The BuybackBurner mechanism can burn LP over time.

## Token Utility

$LOTTERY is a pure game token:
- Earned by being King
- Tradeable on Uniswap
- Governance-enabled (ERC20Votes)

Future governance may control:
- Treasury reserve withdrawals
- Megapot allocation percentage
- BuybackBurner funding
