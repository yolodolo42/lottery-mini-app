# LOTTERY

A king-of-the-hill game on Base where players bid USDC to become King, earn $LOTTERY emissions, and generate real USDC yield through Megapot referral fees.

## What is LOTTERY?

LOTTERY is an onchain game on Base. One player holds the "King" position at a time. The King earns 1 $LOTTERY token per second while they hold the throne.

Anyone can dethrone the current King by placing a higher bid. When dethroned, the previous King receives a USDC payout from the new bid plus any accumulated $LOTTERY emissions.

Every bid also feeds the treasury, which auto-buys Megapot lottery tickets. Megapot pays referral fees on those purchases, and the current King gets 50% of those fees in USDC. So being King earns you tokens *and* stablecoin income at the same time.
